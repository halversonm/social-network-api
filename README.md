# Social Network API

## Description
This app serves as an API for a social network web app users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. By creating this app I was able to practice working with a MongoDB database and the Mongoose ODM.

## Installation
Clone the repo to your local machine and inside the terminal make sure to install the necessary npm dependencies. Make sure you have MongoDB installed on your machine. Follow this [MongoDB installation guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb) to install MongoDB locally.

## Usage
 To start the application, run "npm start" in the terminal. You can test the application by using an app like Insomnia.

 Here is a [short walkthrough video]() showcasing this app's functionality.
